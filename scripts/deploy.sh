# scripts/deploy.sh for stubless-site. Cloudflare Workers.
#
# The estate deploys to Cloudflare Workers through opennextjs-cloudflare. Nothing here targets
# Vercel and this repo carries no vercel.json: measured 2026-09-19, all 57 Vercel projects read
# live:false and hitting a Vercel origin directly returns 402 DEPLOYMENT_DISABLED.
#
# ⛔ THE ORDER IS check, build, deploy, populateCache, verify, AND TWO PARTS OF IT ARE
# COUNTERINTUITIVE.
#
#   The GATE RUNS FIRST, in front of the build, not after the deploy. A deploy script that runs
#   its checks after the promote has already landed turns every finding into something to write
#   up, because by then the work is live and annotating it is the only remaining move. That is
#   the exact failure the package this site is about was built against, so the site would be
#   arguing with its own subject if it ran the gate anywhere else.
#
#   populateCache RUNS AFTER THE DEPLOY. Populating before it leaves the shipped Worker reading
#   an empty cache. Measured on stacktab: four ISR-only routes answered 404 straight after a
#   green deploy, and the identical populate run afterwards turned all four green with nothing
#   else changed.
#
# ⛔ IT ENDS ON A GATE THAT CAN FAIL. An early rulestack run reported exit 0 while no Worker
# existed on the account at all, so every later run would have read as a success while the site
# stayed on the old host. verify-cf.mjs reads the routes back over the network.
