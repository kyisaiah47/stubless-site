/* POSTHOG IS FETCHED AFTER HYDRATION, NEVER BUNDLED INTO THE CRITICAL PATH.
 *
 * Measured on stacktab 2026-09-20, brotli over the wire: the page cost 427,277 bytes and chunk
 * b468fba8 was 93,453 of them, 291 KB raw, and it was posthog-js. It was a static top level
 * import, so every visitor downloaded and parsed the whole analytics SDK before the page could
 * run, to send a pageview that does not fire until after mount anyway. The same static import
 * was in 48 other repos, this one among them.
 *
 * NOTHING MAY BE DROPPED ON THE WAY. Every Compound site is analytics checked daily and a
 * product that reports no traffic reads as dead rather than as unmeasured, so the import cannot
 * simply be moved behind a flag that races the first pageview. init() returns the one promise
 * every caller awaits. The pageview effect awaits it before capturing, so the first pageview of
 * a visit waits for the fetch instead of racing a flag. capture() awaits it too, so a click
 * during the fetch is sent when the fetch lands.
 *
 * The one real cost: an exception thrown before the SDK arrives is not captured. Error tracking
 * starts at hydration now rather than at parse. */

// This comment described one until 2026-08-22 and the mechanism had been removed that morning:

// Vercel edge request and Vercel origin transfer in both directions: 458 GB of Fast Origin
// Transfer ($13.04) and 11.1M function invocations ($2.75) on one invoice. The proxy exists to
// stop ad blockers dropping first-party analytics; that is worth something, but it was never
// priced against what it costs on this platform. Do not reinstate it without pricing it first.
//
// GENERATED from demos/roster/templates/Analytics.tsx.tmpl by the analytics-coverage step of
